I'm Jonathan Cavia, just some random dude doing some random things. 

I like microcontrollers, gardening, making artistic visual representations of code, making a js framework a day to keep the bad doctor away (what?) and high level programming (because I hate assembly (not rly)).

I'm looking to collaborate on anything that you throw at me and I find interesting.

here is my email: jonathancavia0101@gmail.com
  
Cheers and have a nice life.
